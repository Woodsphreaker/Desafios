# Show Me the Evens - Show me the Odds 

Diana is learning to count and she just learned the difference between odds and even numbers. 
She wants to have some fun, so she picks a random number. 
If that number is even, she decides to count all the even numbers up to it starting from 0 up to (but not including) the input. 
If not, she decides to count all the odd numbers up to that number starting from 1 (but not including) the input.
